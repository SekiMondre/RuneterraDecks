# RuneterraDecks

Decks in Legends of Runeterra can be converted into and from a Base32 string that can be easily used to share decks with other players and game clients.
 
## Decoding & Encoding

A deck is represented by a list of card entries. Each entry specify a single card by its corresponding code and how many copies are present in the deck.

### Decoding:

This is an example decoding my favorite Jinx & Draven deck:

```swift
import RuneterraDecks

let deckCode = "CEBAGAIDCQRSOCIBAQAQYEQ4EYTSQLJUAIAQCAYLAEAQIDIA"
let cardEntries = try? DeckDecoder.decode(deckCode)
```

### Encoding:

To encode a deck, just create an `Entry` array for the cards and pass is to the encoder:

```swift
import RuneterraDecks

// Add your card entries to an array in any way you like
let cards = [Entry(cardCode: "01NX020", count: 3), ... ] 
let code = try? DeckEncoder.encode(cards)
```

The library supports up the the Rising Tides (Bilgewater) expansion set.
